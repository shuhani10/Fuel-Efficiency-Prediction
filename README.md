# Fuel-Efficiency-Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project to predict a car's fuel efficiency (MPG) using the Auto MPG dataset.

This project utilizes the Auto MPG dataset to predict a car’s fuel efficiency, measured in miles per gallon (MPG), based on features including the number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, weight, acceleration, model year, and origin. Fuel efficiency, an important indicator of a vehicle’s economy and environmental impact, varies across vehicles due to these attributes.

This project implemented a machine learning workflow to build an accurate regression model for predicting MPG. The process began with loading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure and identify any data quality issues. Missing values were handled, and irrelevant features, such as car name, were removed to simplify the model. Categorical variables were converted into numerical forms, using one-hot encoding for the 'origin' variable to indicate the vehicle's region of manufacture .

To enhance model performance, the dataset is split into training and testing sets, followed by feature scaling using StandardScaler to normalize the numerical values. Multiple regression models were evaluated, starting with Linear Regression as a baseline. We then tested more complex models, including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressor, which generally outperformed the baseline model. Random Forest, in particular, showed promising results after hyperparameter tuning, which optimized parameters like the number of estimators and tree depth to enhance predictive power.

Each model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²). The Random Forest model achieved the highest R² score with minimal errors, establishing it as the most effective model for this task. A plot of actual vs. predicted MPG values visually confirmed the model’s accuracy.This study provides valuable insights into factors influencing fuel efficiency, with potential applications in vehicle design and fuel economy optimization. 
It highlights the effectiveness of machine learning in addressing complex, real-world regression tasks.
